# CS50-Final-Project

## C# - Mastermind Game - Pokémon Theme

For my final project of CS50, I have created a Mastermind Game, themed with Pokémon.

After doing CS50, I went back to college to study Software Development and am learning C# and JavaScript at the moment.
I have created this game as a trial of my knowledge up to this point.

I thank CS50 for the opportunity to delve into the world of Programming and to spark my interest and passion which allowed me to go back to college and
pursue a degree in Computer Science.

I am Lorenzo Latinne,

And this was CS50.
